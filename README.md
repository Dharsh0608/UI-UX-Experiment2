# UI-UX-Experiment2

## Aim:
To design responsive mobile and web layouts for an existing digital product by applying Gestalt principles, UI patterns, usability guidelines, and branding techniques — ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Algorithm:
Step 1: Select an Existing Case Study

1.1 Choose a real-world mobile app or website such as Zomato, Uber, or Flipkart. 1.2 Identify the main purpose and target users of the product. 1.3 Study the existing screens and user flow to understand the current design.

Step 2: Apply Gestalt Principles to Layout Design

2.1 Apply Proximity by grouping related UI elements together to improve clarity. 2.2 Use Similarity by maintaining consistent fonts, colors, and shapes for similar components. 2.3 Implement Continuity by aligning elements to create natural eye movement and flow. 2.4 Apply Closure by designing minimal and partially complete shapes that the mind can interpret. 2.5 Use Figure–Ground contrast to highlight primary content over the background.

Step 3: Design UI Layouts (Mobile & Web)

3.1 Use a design tool like Figma or Adobe XD to create wireframes for mobile and web screens. 3.2 Add essential UI elements such as navigation bars, buttons, input fields, dropdowns, sliders, cards, and lists. 3.3 Use responsive layouts to ensure all components adapt to different screen sizes. 3.4 Incorporate design patterns like onboarding screens, error messages, and empty states.

Step 4: Integrate Interaction & Usability Features

4.1 Define interaction behaviors such as hover effects, tap animations, and content transitions. 4.2 Provide feedback for user actions through loading indicators, success messages, or button animations. 4.3 Apply usability principles:   • Consistency   • Affordance   • Accessibility 4.4 Create touch-friendly targets for mobile and click-friendly elements for web. 4.5 Simulate user journeys such as login, onboarding, checkout, and profile editing.

Step 5: Design a Brand Logo Using Canva

5.1 Start with the selected brand color palette and matching typography. 5.2 Add shapes, icons, and symbols that represent the brand purpose. 5.3 Create a simple, clean, and scalable logo suitable for both mobile and web. 5.4 Export the logo in PNG and SVG formats for easy integration. 5.5 Place the logo in header or footer areas of your layouts to maintain brand identity.

Step 6: Review and Document the Final Output
## Output:
<img width="500" height="500" alt="Black White Minimalist Modern Aesthetic Initials Font Logo (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a18d3ddb-8dc3-4775-b201-8bab5acdd824" />


## Result:
Successfully designed responsive mobile and web layouts for an existing case study using key design principles. Applied Gestalt theory to improve visual structure, integrated standard UI components and patterns, and developed user interactions focused on usability. Created a custom brand logo using Canva, maintaining visual consistency across layouts. This process enhanced my skills in layout planning, responsive design, branding, and user-centered thinking.
